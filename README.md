# Finance Calculator

This program allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan
repayment calculator.

● The code does the following:
1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do.
2. If the user selects ‘investment’, it does the following:
Ask the user to input:
● The amount of money that they are depositing.
● The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered
● The number of years they plan on investing for.
● Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called 'interest'. Depending on whether they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate amount that they will get after the given period at the interest rate.
● Print out the answer
3. If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following:
Ask the user to input:
● The present value of the house. E.g. 100000
● The interest rate. E.g. 7
● The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond. E.g. 120
● Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month and output the answer
